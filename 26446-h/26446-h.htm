<p>[The following pages are, with slight changes, a reprint
from the Proceedings of the Massachusetts Historical
Society, of a paper read before that Society, March 8, 1883,
in answer to a question propounded at a previous meeting,
relative to the authenticity of the tradition that a woman
was burned to death in Massachusetts in the year 1755. As
this case is the only known instance of the infliction of
the common-law penalty for petit treason, in New England,
and is not known to have been elsewhere reported, the
printers have, at the author's request, struck off, in
pamphlet form, a limited number of impressions for the use
of persons interested in the history of our criminal
jurisprudence, who may not have convenient access to the
serial from which it is taken, or who may desire to preserve
it separately.]</p></div>

<p>It is not surprising that the execution of a woman, by burning, so
lately as when Shirley was governor,&mdash;a period when the province had
greatly advanced in culture and refinement,&mdash;should seem to any one
incredible. Indeed, even so critical and thorough a student of our
provincial history as our late distinguished associate, Dr. Palfrey,
once wrote to me inquiring if the rumor of such a proceeding had any
foundation in fact, and if so, whether the execution took place
according to law, or by the impulse of an infuriated mob. It gave me
great satisfaction to be able to settle his doubts on this subject by
referring him to the records of the Superior Court of Judicature,
where the judgment, from which I shall presently read to you, and a
copy of which I sent to him, appears at length.</p>

<p>The subject is important at this day only as serving to define the
nature of the "cruel and unusual punishments" prohibited by the
thirty-first article of the Declaration of Rights, in our state
Constitution, since this mode of punishment, having continued after
the adoption of the Constitution, cannot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span> have been considered by the
framers of that instrument either as "cruel" or "unusual" in the sense
in which they used these words.</p>

<p>The particulars of the crime for which the malefactors, Mark and
Phillis, were executed are briefly as follows: Captain John Codman, a
thrifty saddler, sea-captain, and merchant, of Charlestown, was the
owner of several slaves whom he employed either as mechanics, common
laborers, or house servants. Three of the most trusted of these, Mark,
Phillis, and Phebe,&mdash;particularly Mark,&mdash;found the rigid discipline of
their master unendurable, and, after setting fire to his workshop some
six years before, hoping by the destruction of this building to so
embarrass him that he would be obliged to sell them, they, in the year
1755, conspired to gain their end by poisoning him to death.</p>

<p>In this confederacy some five or six negroes belonging to other owners
were more or less directly implicated. Mark, the leader, was able to
read, and signed his examination, hereafter referred to, in a bold,
legible hand. He professed to have read the Bible through, in order to
find if, in any way, his master could be killed without inducing
guilt, and had come to the conclusion that according to Scripture no
sin would be committed if the act could be accomplished without
bloodshed. It seems, moreover, to have been commonly believed by the
negroes that a Mr. Salmon had been poisoned to death by one of his
slaves, without discovery of the crime. So, application was made by
Mark, first to Kerr, the servant of Dr. John Gibbons, and then to
Robin, the servant of Dr. Wm. Clarke, at the North End of Boston, for
poison from their masters' apothecary stores, which was to be
administered by the two women.</p>

<p>Essex, the servant of Thomas Powers, had also furnished Mark with a
quantity of "black lead" for the same purpose. This was,
unquestionably, not the harmless plumbago to which that name is now
usually given, but galena, or <i>plumbum nigrum</i>, a native sulphuret of
lead, probably used for a glaze by the potters of Charlestown.</p>

<p>Kerr declined to have any hand in the business; but Robin twice
obtained and delivered to Mark a quantity of arsenic, of which the
women, Phebe and Phillis, made a solution which they kept secreted in
a vial, and from time to time mixed with the water-gruel and sago
which they sometimes gave directly to their victim to eat, and at
other times prepared to be innocently administered to him by one of
his daughters. They also mixed with his food some of the "black lead,"
which Phillis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span> seems to have thought was the efficient poison, though
it appeared from the testimony that he was killed by the arsenic.</p>

<p>The crime was promptly traced home to the conspirators; and on the
second day of July, the day after Captain Codman's death, a coroner's
jury found that he died from poison feloniously procured and
administered by Mark. Ten days later, Quaco,&mdash;the nominal husband of
Phebe, and one of the negroes implicated,&mdash;who was the servant of Mr.
James Dalton, of Boston, was examined before William Stoddard, a
justice of the peace, and on the same day Robin was arrested and
committed to jail. The examination of Quaco was followed by the
examination of Mark, and of Phillis, later in the month. These last
were taken before the Attorney-General and Mr. Thaddeus Mason.</p>

<p>At the term of the "Superiour Court of Judicature, Court of Assize,
and General Goal Delivery," held at Cambridge on the second Tuesday of
August following, the grand jury found a true bill for petit treason
against Phillis, and against Mark and Robin as accessories before the
fact. As this is the only indictment for this offence known to have
been found in Massachusetts, and was drawn by that eminent lawyer,
Edmund Trowbridge, then Attorney-General, it is worthy of being
preserved in print, in connection with the coroner's verdict and the
examinations of the suspected parties, which are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Examination of Phillis a negro Servant of John Codman late of
Charlstown deceased taken by Edmund Trowbridge and Thaddeus Mason
Esq<span class="super">rs</span> at Cambridge in the County of Middlesex the 26<span class="super">th.</span> Day of
July Anno Domini 1755. And y<span class="super">e</span> 2<span class="super">d</span> of Aug<span class="super">t.</span> following&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Quest<span class="super">n</span>.</i> Was M<span class="super">r.</span> John Codman late of Charlstown de[=c]d, your
Master?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> Yes he was.</p>

<p><i>Ques<span class="super">t</span>.</i> How long was you his servant?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> He my said Master bought me when I was a little girl and I
continued his servant untill his Death.</p>

<p><i>Quest<span class="super">n</span>.</i> Do you know of what sickness your said master died?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> I suppose he was poisoned.</p>

<p><i>Ques<span class="super">t</span>.</i> Do you know he was poisoned?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> I do know he was poisoned.</p>

<p><i>Ques<span class="super">t</span>.</i> What was he poisoned with?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i>&mdash;It was with that black lead.</p>

<p><i>Ques<span class="super">t</span>.</i> what black Lead is it you mean?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> The Potter's Lead.</p>

<p><i>Ques<span class="super">t</span>.</i> How do you know your s<span class="super">d.</span> master was poisoned with that
Lead?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> Mark got some of the said Potter's Lead from Essex Powers
and my young mistress Molly found some of the same Lead in the
Porringer that my Master's Sagoe was in, he complain'd it was gritty;
and that made Miss Molly look into the Porringer, and finding the Lead
there, she ask'd me what it was, I told her I did not know.&mdash;I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
cleaned the Skillet the Sagoe was boiled in and found some of the same
stuff in the bottom of the skillet that was in the bottom of the
Porringer. And presently after Mark was carried to Goal, Tom brought a
Paper of the Potter's Lead out of the Blacksmith's Shop, which he said
he found there; and I saw it and am sure it was the same with that
which Was in the bottom of the Porringer and the Skillet.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> Do you know that any other Poison besides the Potter's Lead
was given to your s<span class="super">d</span> master?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> Yes.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> What was it?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> It was Water which was poured out of a Vial.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> How do you know that, that Water was Poison?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> There was a White Powder in the Vial, which Sunk to the
Bottom of it.&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> Do you know who put the Powder into the Vial?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> I put the first Powder in.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> Where did you get that Powder?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> Phebe gave it to me up in the Garret, the Sabbath Day
morning before the last Sacrament before my master dyed, and Ph&#339;be
at the same time told me Mark gave it to her.</p>

<p><i>Ques<span class="super">t</span>.</i> What was the Powder in when Ph&#339;be gave it you?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> It was in a White Paper, folded up Square, both ends being
turn'd up, &amp; it was tyed with some Twine.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> How much Powder was there in the Paper?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> There was a good deal of it I believe near an ounce.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> Did you put all that Powder into the Vial?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> No, I put in but a little of it, only so much as lay on
the Point of a narrow Piece of flat Iron, with which I put it in,
which Iron Mark made &amp; gave it to me to give to Phebe, Mark gave me
the s<span class="super">d</span> Iron the Saturday before the Sabbath afores<span class="super">d</span>. I ask'd him
what it was for, he would not tell me; he said Robbin gave him one,
and he had lost it; and that he himself went into the shop and made
this. I gave the s<span class="super">d</span> Iron to Ph&#339;be that same afternoon, in the
Kitchen; and the next morning she gave it to me in the Garret, and
Quaco was there with her; she whisper'd to me and told me to take the
Paper of Powder which was in the hollow over the Window, and the flat
Iron which was with it and put some of it into the Vial with the Iron

<p><i>Quest.</i> Who pour'd it into his barly Drink?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> I did it myself; I pour'd a drop out of the Vial into the

<p><i>Quest.</i> Who put the Second Powder into the Vial?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> Ph&#339;be put it in; I left Part of the Powder she gave me
in the Paper, and she afterwards put that into the Vial as she told
me. as I was in the cellar drawing some Cyder, I heard Ph&#339;be tell
Mark that the Powder was all out, and all used up;</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> When was it that you heard Ph&#339;be tell Mark so?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> The Wednesday before my master dyed.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> Do you know of any more Powder being got to give to your
master?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> Yes, but master never took any of it.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> Who got this last Powder?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> Mark got it.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> What did he do with it?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> He gave it to me; in our little House.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> What Sort of Powder was it that Mark gave You?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> I[t?] was white the same as the first.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> What was it in?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> In a Peice of Paper; he had more of that Powder than he
gave me, it was in a Paper folded up in a long Square, he tore off
Part of that Paper, and put Some of the Powder into it, and gave it to
me and kept the rest himself. and at the same time that he gave it to
me he told me that Robbin said we were damn'd Fools we had not given
Master that first Powder at two Doses, for it wou'd have killed him,
and no Body would have known who hurt him, for it was enough to kill
the strongest man living; upon which I ask'd Mark how he knew, it
would not have been found out, he said that Mr. Salmon's Negros
poison'd him, and were never found out, but had got good masters, &amp; so
might we.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span></p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> What did you do with that Powder which Mark gave you?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> I put it into the Vial, &amp; set it in the Same Place it was
in before, there was some of the first Powder &amp; Water remaining in the
Vial when I put this last in.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> Do you know that any of the Water that was in the Vial after
you put this last Powder in was given to your Master?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> No, he never had a drop of it. The next Day after Master
died Mark came into the Closet where I was eating my Dinner and ask'd
me for that Bottle. I ask'd him what he wanted it for, and he would
not tell me, but insisted upon having it, upon which I told him that
it was there behind the Jugg, and he took it and went directly down to
the Shop in the yard, and I never saw it afterwards 'till Justice
Mason shew it to me, on the Fast Day night.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> Do you know where Mark got that Powder which he gave to you?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> He had it of Robbin, Doc<span class="super">tr</span> Clark's Negro; that liv'd
with Mr. Vassall.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> How do you know that Mark had that Powder of Robbin?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> The Thursday night before my master died Mark told me he
was going over to Boston to Robbin to get some more Powder for he
s<span class="super">d:</span> Ph&#339;be told him y<span class="super">t</span> the other was all out; and Mark went
over to Boston, and return'd again about nine o'Clock; and I ask'd
Mark if he had got it, and he told me no, he had not, but Robbin was
to bring it over the next night; and between 8 &amp; 9 o'Clock that next
night, a negro Fellow came to me in our Yard &amp; ask'd me for Mark, And
I ask'd him his name but he would not tell me, and I said to him,
Countryman, if you'l tell me your name I'll call Mark, for I know
where he is, but he would not, I then askt him if he was not Robbin
Vassall, (for I mistrusted it was he) and upon that he laughed and
said his name was not Robbin Vassall, but he came out of the Country
and wanted to see Mark very much about his Child; and upon my refusing
to tell him where Mark was the negro went away down to the Ferry, and
I followed him at some distance &amp; saw him go into the Ferry Boat, and
the Boat put off, with him in it. That same Fryday, in the afternoon,
Mark told me, if any Negro Fellow shou'd come; &amp; say that he came out
of the Country to call him, I ask'd him what negro it was that he
expected wou'd come; he told me it was Robbin, and that he was to say
that he came out of the Country to speak with Mark about his Child,
and bid me tell no Body about it.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> Do you know Robbin Doct<span class="super">r.</span> Clark's negro?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> I do, and have known him for many years.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> How then happen'd it that you cou'd not certainly tell
whether the negro afores<span class="super">d.</span> that askt for Mark was Robbin or not?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> Because it was dark, So dark I cou'd not see his Face so
as certainly to know him, but I am fully satisfyed it was Robbin.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> What Reason have you to be satisfyed it was Robbin?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> That same night I told Mark that a negro Fellow had been
there and ask'd for him &amp; wanted him, he ask'd me why I did not call<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
him, I told him our Folks called me and I could not, Mark told me he
was very Sorry I did not, and asked me if he gave me any Thing, I told
him he did not, he said he was very sorry he did not; then I ask'd him
who it was, and he said it was Robbin, and then he told me that he
thought Robbin &amp; he had been playing blind-mans Buff, for they had
been over the Ferry twice that night and mist one another; and that
Elij<span class="super">h</span> Phipps &amp; Timo Rand told him that a negro Fellow had been over
the Ferry to speak with him about his Child. And then Mark told me he
would the next Night go over to Robbin and get some more of the same
Powder, and would bring it over on the Sabbath Day, &amp; he went to
Boston on the Saturday night, but did not return till Monday morning,
when he brought it and gave it to me in the little House, as I told
you before.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> Did you see Robbin at Charlstown in the Time of your master's
sickness or about the Time of his Death?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> Yes, I saw him on y<span class="super">e</span> Tuesday the Ship was launched,
when my master catch'd Mark buying Drink at M<span class="super">rs</span> Shearman's to treat
him with, &amp; drove him away; and I saw him at Charlstown on the
Saturday after my Master was buried; but I did not speak with him at
either of those Times. The Tuesday he was before our Shop Door, in the
Street, with Mark and had a Bag upon his shoulder; and on the Saturday
in the afternoon I saw him going up the Street by our House, while
Ph&#339;be and I were washing in the back yard; I told Ph&#339;be there
was Robbin a going along this minit, and she said is he? and ask'd me
what Cloaths he had on; I told her he had a bluish Coat on lined with
a straw coloured or yellow lining and the Cuffs open &amp; lined with the
said Yellow lining, and that he had a black wigg on; and I told
Ph&#339;be I believed he was gone up to Mark to tell him not to own that
he had given any Thing to him, and Ph&#339;be said she believed so to;
and I went into the street to the Pump with a Pail to get some Water,
designing to see whether he went that Way, and I saw him go right up
the main street, and I could see him as far up as Mr. Eleazer
Phillips's, and I did not see him afterwards. I never see him with a
Wigg on before, but as he went by us he look'd me full in the Face and
I knew it was Robbin. When I told Ph&#339;be that Robbin was going by, I
thought she saw him, but she questioned whether it was he, and I told
her I was sure it was he, for I had known him ever since he was a boy,
and I told her I would lay a mug of Flip that it was he, but she wou'd
not; and then it was that I told her I believed he was gone up to Mark
&amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> Do you know what Powder that was which Mark &amp; Ph&#339;be gave
you, and you put into the Vial?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> Mark told me it was Ratsbane, but I told Ph&#339;be I
believed Mark lied &amp; that it was only burnt allom, for I told her,
that upon taking Ratsbane they would directly swell, and Master did
not swell; and she said she believed so to.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> How many Times was any of that Water, which was in the Vial
afores<span class="super">d.</span>, put into your master's victuals?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span></p><p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> Not above Seven Times.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> When was the first Time?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> The next Monday morning after Ph&#339;be gave me the first
Powder. then it was put into his Chocalate, by Ph&#339;be. The next was
also put in to his Chocalate by Ph&#339;be on the next Wednesday
morning, and I thinking she put in more than she should, told her her
hand was heavy, and there was no more put in, that, I know of till the
next Fryday, when Ph&#339;be put some into his Chocalate, and my Master
eat the Chocalate all the three times aforesaid in the Kitchen, and I
was there &amp; saw him; The next was on the Saturday following, when I
put Some into his Watergruel, but I felt ugly and threw it away, and
made some fresh, and did not put any into that. The next was on the
afternoon of the same Saturday, I made him some more Watergruel &amp;
pour'd some of the Water out of the Vial into it, and it turned
yellow, and Miss Betty, ask'd me what was the matter with the
Watergruel and I gave her no answer; but that was thrown away, and
more fresh made, and Miss Molly was going to put the same Plumbs in
again, and Ph&#339;be told her not to do it, but she had better put in
some fresh Plumbs, and she did; and no Poison was put into that; It
was by Ph&#339;be's advice that I put it into the first this afternoon.
And he had no more, that I know of 'till the next Monday night, when
Mark put some of the Potter's Lead into Masters Sagoe.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> How do you know that Mark put any of the Potter's Lead into
the Sagoe?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> When I went out of the Kitchen I left the Sagoe in the
little Iron Skillet on the Fire, and no body was in the Kitchen then,
but when I returned, Mark was Sitting on a Form in the Corner, and I
afterwards found Some of that Lead in the Skillet, and neither
Ph&#339;be nor I had any Such Lead.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> Do you know of any other Poison prepar'd for, or given to
your Master?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> No, I do not.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> Who was it that first contrived the poisoning your Master
Codman?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> It was Mark who first contrived it, He told Ph&#339;be and I
that he had read the Bible through, and that it was no Sin to kill him
if they did not lay violent Hands on him So as to shed Blood, by
sticking or stabbing or cutting his Throat.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> When was it that Mark first proposed the poisoning his
Master?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> Some time last Winter; he proposed it to Ph&#339;be and I,
but we would not agree to it, and told him No Such Thing should be
done in the House; This before my Master brought him home from Boston.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> Did he ever afterwards propose the poisoning his s<span class="super">d</span>
Master?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> Yes he did, a Week or a Fortnight after my Master brought
him home from Boston, he proposed it to me first, and I would not
agree to it, and then he proposed it to Ph&#339;be.</p>

<p><i>Quet.</i> What Reason did Mark give for poisoning his Master?</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> He said he was uneasy and wanted to have another Master, and
he was concerned for Ph&#339;be and I too.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span></p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> Do you know how your Master's Work house that was burnt down
came on Fire?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> Yes I do.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> How came it on fire?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> I set it on fire, but it was thro' Mark's means, he gave
me no rest 'till I did it.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> How did you Set your Master's Work House on fire?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> I threw a Coal of Fire into some Shavings between the
Blacksmith's Shop &amp; the Work House, and I went away &amp; did not see it
kindle.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> Who put the Shavings there?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> Mark did.</p>

<p><i>Ques<span class="super">t.</span></i> Was any Body concern'd in the burning the Work house
besides Mark and you?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> Yes, Ph&#339;be knew about it as well as I.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> Where was Ph&#339;be &amp; Mark when you put the Coal of Fire into
the Shavings?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> The were up Garret in bed.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> Who first proposed the Setting the Workhouse on fire? and
what reason was given for doing it?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> Mark first proposed it, to Ph&#339;be and I; and the Reason
he gave us was that he wanted to get to Boston, and if all was burnt
down, he did not know what Master could do without selling us.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> Why did you, when Ph&#339;be pour'd Some of the Water out of
the Vial into the Chocalate tell her, "her hand was heavy?"</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> I thought she pour'd in too much, more than she should I
felt ugly and I wan't willing she shou'd put in so much and that he
should be kill'd so quick. Mark's orders were to give it in two Doses,
that was the Directions Robbin gave to Mark, as Mark told me, and Mark
Said Robbin told him there was no more taste in it than in Cold Water.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> Why did you not tell your Master or some of the Family that
Ph&#339;be had poisoned the Chocalate, and thereby prevent your Master's
eating it?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> I do not know why I did not tell.</p>

too by her and Ph&#339;be; and then I went to Ph&#339;be and ask'd her
about it, and She denyed it at first but when I told her that Phillis
had told me all about it, then she owned it.</p>

<p><i>Ques<span class="super">t.</span></i> Had you no Reason before your s<span class="super">d.</span> master dyed to think
that the Powders you had of Robbin were given to your master or that
he was poison'd therewith?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span></p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> No other Reason than hearing Ph&#339;be the Saturday night
before master died ask Phillis, if she had given him enough, to which
she replyed, yes. I have given him enough, and will stick as close to
him as his shirt to his back; but who she meant I did not then know,
nor untill after master died.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> Was there no Discourse had between you Ph&#339;be &amp; Phillis
about getting more Poison, after you had the first, of Robbin?</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> The Fryday before my master died Ph&#339;be told me that she had
lost that stuff that I had brought to her from Robbin, and desired me
to get her some more. I told her I wou'd when I went over to Boston;
this was in the Forenoon, when she was washing in the back yard.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> Did you get her any more of Robbin?</p>

<p><i>Ans<span class="super">r</span>.</i> Yes, and that was it which I gave to Phillis</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> When did you go over to get the last Poison?</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> on the Saturday night before my master died; I went over after
Sunset; I went directly to Robbin; &amp; told him I wanted some of the
same I had of him before for that was lost, Robbin was then at the
Corner of his master's House out in the street, he told me he could
not get any then, but if I wou'd come on the Sabbath Day night he
would let me have some, and I went to him on the Sabbath Day night
after Candle Light, and he then gave it to me.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> Was there any Body with you on the Saturday night when you
ask'd for the Poison, or do you know whether any Person saw you &amp;
Robbin together that Evening?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> No, nobody was there, and I dont know that any Body saw us
together that Evening.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> How long was you with Robbin at M<span class="super">r.</span> Harris's Work house?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> I made no tarry there, but left him at the Pot house, and
he and the young man that was with him followed me and overtook me a
little below M<span class="super">r.</span> Waite's Slaughter house; And they went with me
into the Lane leading from the market Place to the long Wharffe near
M<span class="super">rs.</span> Shearman's, while I went into M<span class="super">rs.</span> Shearmans and got a mug
of Toddy, in the mug I brought from M<span class="super">r.</span> Harris's Work house, and I
carried it to them and they both drank with me.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> Had you any Discourse with Robbin in private or between you
and him alone that Day?</p>

<p><i>Ansr.</i> No, none at all.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> Where did you drink the Toddy?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> In the Lane afores<span class="super">d.</span></p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> Where did you all go after you drank the Toddy?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> We all came away together &amp; went thro' M<span class="super">r.</span> Sprague's
Yard &amp; so thro' M<span class="super">rs.</span> Silence Harris's yard &amp; Entry into the street.
and they went directly down to the Ferry and I went into my master's
Yard with the Pots I brought from the Potters Work house.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> Did you then go with them to the Ferry or nearer to it than
your master's House?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span></p><p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> No, I did not.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> Did Robbin give you, or did you give Robbin any Thing between
the Time of your coming out of M<span class="super">r.</span> Harris's Entry and his going
over the Ferry?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> No, I did not give him any Thing neither did he give me
any Thing.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> After you had parted with him when you came thro' the Entry,
did you call him back?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> No, I did not.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> Did your master that Day forbid M<span class="super">rs</span> Shearman's letting you
have any more Drink?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> Yes, my master told her not to sell any Drink to any of
his Servants.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> Did Robbin know of it?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> Not that I know of; he see master go into M<span class="super">rs.</span>
Shearman's Shop, and pass'd by Robbin in the Lane as Robbin told me.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> Did you ever apply to any body else, besides Robbin for
Poison?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> No, only to Carr, Doct<span class="super">r.</span> Gibbon's negro man, and then
Ph&#339;be sent me for it. She had been with Carr before on the same
account, &amp; he told her he cou'd not get her any then, as she told me;</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> Did you get any Poison of Carr?</p>

<p><i>Ans<span class="super">r.</span></i> No, he told me he wou'd not let me have any, untill he had
seen Quaco, and did not know whether he shou'd then or not, and I
never went to him afterwards.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> Did you never ask Doct<span class="super">r.</span> Rand's Cato for any Poison?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> No, I do not know that I ever did, in the World.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> Had you and Ph&#339;be any Conversation together about your
master in or near your Blacksmith's Shop or in the yard the Monday
before your master died?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> I had not, that I know of.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> Did you that Day before Tom or any other of your master's
Servants say that you knew that your master would dye or utter any
Words to that effect?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> No, I did not. The Day before master dyed, Ph&#339;be came
into the Shop to dress Tom's Eye &amp; got to dancing &amp; mocking master &amp;
shaking herself &amp; acting as master did in the Bed; And Tom said he did
not care, he hop'd he wou'd never get up again for his Eye's sake, and
Scipio was there at the same time and saw her.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> Did you ever Say that your master had been offer'd &pound;400 for
you but wou'd not take it, and now he shou'd not have a farthing or
Words to that effect?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> No I never said any such Thing. <span style="margin-left: 3em;"><span class="smcap">Mark.</span><a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> Did you ever tell Ph&#339;be or Phillis that the Week before
your master dyed, that you went over the Ferry to see Robbin to get
some more Poison, and that he came over the Ferry in another Boat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span> and
so you mist each other and that he Robbin pretended to the Ferry-man
that he was a Country negro and wanted to see you about your Child, or
Words to that Effect?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> I never told them or either of them so.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> How came that Viall buried near your Forge in the
Black-Smith's Shop, that you told M<span class="super">r.</span> Kettell of, and he found
there?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> I buried it there.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> When did you bury it there?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> In the afternoon of that Day that master dyed.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> Where did you get that Vial?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> I took it from Phillis that same Afternoon.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> Did any body see you take it from her?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> No. When I took it from Phillis she own'd that Ph&#339;be
had given the first Poison that I brought to master; and that she and
Ph&#339;be had given him all the Rest saving what was then in the
Bottle. and thereupon I went to Ph&#339;be and charged her with it, she
at first deny'd it, but at last own'd it it and begg'd me to say
nothing about it; I told her if I had known she wou'd have put it to
that use I would not have got it for her; then I call'd Pompey to go
down to the shop with me for I wanted to speak with him, intending to
shew him the Vial, and he came into the shop but before I had an
opportunity to speak to him M<span class="super">r.</span> Kettell took me.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> Where was the Vial when you talked with Ph&#339;be as
afores<span class="super">d</span>?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> I had it in my Pocket, and told her so, then I went into
the shop and buried it, then I went into the House immediately to call
Pompey to shew it to him.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> Why did you bury the Vial before you called Pompy? or shew it
to any body?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r:</span></i> I buried it because I did not want any body should see it
before I shewed it to him.</p>

<p><i>Quest<span class="super">n.</span></i> Have you lately had any Potters powder'd Lead by you or
in your Possession?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> Only that I had from Essex Powars; which was as I suppose
ground to Powder.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> When did you get that powder'd Lead of Essex?</p>

<p><i>Ans<span class="super">r:</span></i> I had it of him that Day I went there for six butter Pots,
which my master's son Isaac sent me for.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> What did you get that Lead for?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> To see if it would melt in our Fire. upon a Dispute
between Tom and I about it; Tom said it would melt, and I told him I
did not believe it would; I carried it home and laid it upon the Wall
Plate in the Blacksmith's shop, and I never moved it afterwards or
thought any Thing about it, 'till it was show'd to me by the Justice.</p>

<p><i>Quet.</i> Do you know that any Part of that Lead you had of Essex or any
Lead like unto it was given to your master or put into his Victuals or
Drink?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> I do not.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> Do you know of any Proposal made of poisoning your master?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span></p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> No, I do not, nor ever heard any such Thing proposed by any
Body.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> Do you know of any Cushoe nuts being procured for that
Purpose?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> No; I have not seen a Cushoe nut since I have been in this
Country.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> Do you know of any Copperas or Green stuff being provided for
that Purpose?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> No I do not.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> What Time on the Saturday before your master dyed was it that
you heard Ph&#339;be ask Phillis, if she had given him enough, and
Phillis said she had, and would stick as close to him as his Shirt to
his Back?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> In the afternoon about Dark; and before I went to Boston.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> How came you, after you had heard this Talk between Ph&#339;be
and Phillis, to get her s<span class="super">d.</span> Ph&#339;be more Poison?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> I did not know what she meant by their Talk, nor who they
meant, by him.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> Did you tell Carr that Ph&#339;be sent you for that Poison you
applyed to him for?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> She did not tell me it was Poison, but told me to ask Carr
for that Thing he had promised her; he said he knew what it was and
would not send it, 'till he had talked to Quaco, and did not know that
he should send it afterwards; and I said no more to Carr about it.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> Did you ever ask Carr at any other Time for Poison?</p>

<p><i>Ans<span class="super">r</span>.</i> No.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> Did you never ask him for something to Poison or kill a Dog?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> No, not that I know of.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> Was you ever bit by a Dog?</p>

<p><i>Answ<span class="super">r</span>.</i> No. I never was.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> Do you know any Thing more of your master's being poisoned
than you have before related?</p>

<p><i>Ans<span class="super">r</span>.</i> No, I do not.</p>

<p>I Executed this warrant as above directed, by causing Phillis to be

between the hours of one and five a Clock of Said day&mdash;</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Rich<span class="super">d.</span> Foster</span> <i>Sheriff</i><br />
</p>

<hr />

<p>It is worthy of observation that no such process as a formal warrant
was required for a capital execution by the laws of England. In the
King's Bench, the prisoner was committed to the custody of the marshal
at the beginning of the trial, and an award of judgment upon the
record was all the authority that that officer had for the execution.
Formerly, it was customary in courts of oyer and terminer, and of jail
delivery, to authorize the execution by a precept under the hands and
seals of three or more commissioners, of whom one, at least, should be
of the quorum; but this custom had become obsolete at the time of this
trial, and only a calendar, or abstract of the record, subscribed by
the judge, was put into the hands of the sheriff for this purpose; and
such is the practice in England, I presume, to this day.</p>

<p>Even Blackstone, who is so blind to many gross imperfections in the
jurisprudence of his native country, is forced to remark, in view of
the looseness of procedure in capital cases,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It may certainly afford matter of speculation that in civil
causes there should be such a variety of writs of execution
to recover a trifling debt, issued in the king's name, and
under the seal of the court, without which the sheriff
cannot legally stir one step; and yet that the execution of
a man, the most important and terrible task of any, should
depend upon a marginal note."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p></div>

<p>The courts and people of New England were always more mindful of the
sacredness of human life than those of other nations, save, perhaps,
the little community of the Netherlands. They also attached great
importance to the formal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span> proceedings by which the ends of justice
were reached in criminal cases. This is well illustrated by an
incident that is recorded relative to the action of the judges of the
Superior Court of the Province when, after the conviction of
Richardson for the murder of the boy Sneider, in 1770, it became
evident to them that the cause of justice required that they should
intercede to prevent his execution. They were long in doubt as to the
sufficiency of a pardon obtained from the crown through the
recommendation of the Lieutenant-Governor upon their certificate of
its propriety, the only evidence of the pardon being its insertion in
the Newgate Calendar. Hutchinson relates that "they were at length
satisfied; and the prisoner having been brought into court early in
the morning, when scarcely anybody but the officers of the court were
present, pleaded his Majesty's pardon, and was discharged, and
immediately absconded."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>But, to proceed with a definition of the crime committed by these
negroes, and a more particular account of the punishment for petit
treason:&mdash;</p>

<p>By the statute 25 Edw. III., this crime, which had had a wider
application, was restricted to three classes of cases: 1, where a
servant killed his master or mistress; 2, where a wife killed her
husband; 3, where a clergyman killed his prelate, or the superior to
whom he owed canonical obedience. The sentence in the case of a woman
was, that she be burned to death, and in the case of a man, that he be
drawn to the place of execution and there hanged by the neck until he
be dead.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> To mitigate the sufferings of felons at the stake, the
executioner usually fastened one end of a cord to the stake, and
bringing this cord around the neck of the woman, pulled it tightly the
moment the torch was applied, and continued the strain until life was
extinct, which, unless the cord was sooner burnt asunder, generally
happened before the condemned had suffered much from the intensity of
the flames.</p>

<p>In cases of high treason, other barbarities were practised upon the
bodies of the criminals, but these were frequently,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span> and in cases of
persons of distinction, generally, remitted. Indeed, even the hanging
was dispensed with in these latter cases; and hence we read of the
execution of great prisoners of state, male and female, by beheading,
which, strictly, is a manner of death unknown to the laws of England,
except as an incident to the principal penalty by hanging or burning.
After the hanging, the body, according to rule, was to be cut down (if
possible, while yet alive) to be eviscerated, then beheaded, and the
trunk and limbs divided into four parts, to be disposed of as the
sovereign should order. By special writ, under the privy seal, all
these circumstances, except decapitation, were, as I have already
said, usually omitted.</p>

<p>All male persons convicted whether of high treason or of petit treason
were, unless specially exempted in the manner I have stated, <i>drawn</i>
to the place of execution. This was originally an ignominious incident
of the terrible penalty, and required that the criminal should be
rudely pulled along over the ground, behind a horse; later, however, a
hurdle or wicker frame, or a sledge,&mdash;that is, as we call it, a
sled,&mdash;was used, either from motives of humanity, or in order to
prolong the life of the traitor through subsequent stages of the
punishment. According to Sir Matthew Hale, women were not to be drawn,
in cases of petit treason, although the practice of later times,
certainly, was to the contrary.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> However, after the repeal in 1790,
of the law for burning women, for which drawing and hanging were then
substituted, women as well as men were sentenced to be drawn to the
place of execution.</p>

<p>Another incident to this punishment, though not peculiar to it, since
it applied to all atrocious felonies, was the gibbeting, or hanging in
chains. This was no part of the sentence, but was performed in
accordance with a special order or direction of the court, given,
probably, in most cases, ver<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>bally to the sheriff. After execution,
the body of the felon was taken from the gallows and hung upon a
gibbet conveniently near the place where the fact was committed, there
to remain, until, from the action of the elements, or the ravages of
birds of prey, it disappeared. Of the object of this ghastly feature
of capital punishment it is alleged, "besides the terror of the
example," "that it is a comfortable sight to the friends and relations
of the deceased"; but the obviousness of this reason is somewhat
lessened by the doubt in which we are left as to which deceased
person, the criminal or his victim, is referred to. In the case of
Mark it is noticeable that no sentence to the gibbet appears in the
record, and I have found no order for it, or mention of it, in the
papers on file.</p>

<p>Phillis and Mark were executed at the usual place of execution in
Cambridge; and the following account of the affair is taken from the
Boston "Evening Post," of Sept. 22, 1755:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Thursday last, in the Afternoon, <i>Mark</i>, a Negro Man, and
<i>Phillis</i>, a Negro Woman, both Servants to the late Capt.
<i>John Codman</i>, of <i>Charlestown</i>, were executed at
<i>Cambridge</i>, for poisoning their said Master, as mentioned
in this Paper some Weeks ago. The Fellow was hanged, and the
Woman burned at a Stake about Ten Yards distant from the
Gallows. They both confessed themselves guilty of the Crime
for which they suffered, acknowledged the Justice of their
Sentence, and died very penitent. After Execution, the Body
of <i>Mark</i> was brought down to <i>Charlestown</i> Common, and
hanged in Chains, on a Gibbet erected there for that
Purpose."</p></div>

<p>Frothingham, in his "History of Charlestown,"<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> quotes this item
from the "Post," and adds, from Dr. Josiah Bartlett's account of
Charlestown,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> that "the place where Mark was suspended in irons was
on the northerly side of Cambridge Road, about one fourth of a mile
above our peninsula." He also adds, from the same authority, that
"Phebe, who was the most culpable," became evidence against the
others, and that she was transported to the West Indies.</p>

<p>It is very likely that Phebe was transported, as described by Dr.
Bartlett, but there is nothing on record to show that she was used as
a principal witness. Indeed, the answers of Phillis and Mark on their
examination are mutually recriminative, and amount to a plenary
confession of the crime of each. Besides, as neither the governor nor
the court had any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span> authority to grant a pardon for murder,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> it is
not likely that any favor was shown to her in accordance with a
promise from either, nor is there any evidence that any lenity was
actually extended to her, except the negative circumstance that she
was not included in the indictment.</p>

<p>This completes the narrative of this remarkable case. The body of Mark
is said by Dr. Bartlett to have remained on the gibbet "until a short
time before the Revolution." Certain it is that when Dr. Caleb Rea
passed through Charlestown on the first day of June, 1758, on his way
from Danvers to join the regiment, of which he had been chosen
surgeon, in the expedition against Ticonderoga, he found the body
hanging, and, having examined it, recorded in his journal that "his
[Mark's] skin was but very little broken, although he had hung there
near three or four years."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Finally, another patriot,&mdash;Paul Revere,&mdash;in describing his famous ride
on the 18th of April, 1775, on a still more important errand, says,
"After I had passed Charlestown Neck, and got nearly opposite where
<i>Mark was hung in chains</i>, I saw two men on horseback under a
tree,"<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> &amp;c.; thus alluding to the site of the gibbet as a place
well known at that time,&mdash;as undoubtedly it was, to all the country
round.</p>

<p>I have said that this is the only case of petit treason to be found in
our records. There was, indeed, an earlier case in which the penalty
of death by burning was inflicted; but in regard to that case there is
no suggestion anywhere to my knowledge that the crime of petit treason
had been committed, nor any allegation to that effect in the charge or
indictment, nor even a hint that any life was lost by the misconduct
of the condemned.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> This was the case of Maria, a negress,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span> who was
executed at Roxbury in 1681. Perhaps it will be well to give the story
of this case as it appears on the records of the Court of
Assistants.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>The case was capital under the act referred to in the record. The act
reads as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>And if any person of the age aforesaid, [16 years and
upwards] shall after the publication hereof, wittingly and
willingly, and felloniously, set on fire any <i>Dwelling

<p>It will be observed that the law prescribes no such punishment as was
ordered by the Assistants, and how the court<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span> were satisfied of the
legality of their sentence is to me inexplicable, except upon the
possible claim that they might rightfully exercise the expansive
discretion which they applied to the case of the first Quakers, and so
supply a deficiency in the ordinances of the General Court, by
administering the <i>lex talionis</i><a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> in this particular instance as a
necessary terror to evil-doers.</p>

<p>The public opinion which permitted the colonial magistrates to
exercise, unchallenged, a discretion not given to them by positive
law, as in this case and that of the first Quakers, and in the
instance of their conviction of a capital crime, of Tom, the Indian,
in 1674,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> of whose guilt the jury were doubtful, cannot be deemed
to have enlarged their authority, by <i>custom</i>, without a perversion of
language and a disregard of fundamental distinctions relative to the
nature and source of law.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>There was some excuse for the latter part of this sentence, for since
the offence was an atrocious felony, such as in England would subject
the offender to an infamous punishment, it seemed proper to attach
something more of ignominy to his sentence than the mere execution by
hanging.</p>

<p>Our forefathers of the colonial period regarded the Mosaic law as of
too sacred obligation to be impaired in the least degree; much more to
be expressly contravened by the courts of justice in respect to the
command,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he
be to be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree, his body
shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in
any wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged is
accursed of God;) that thy land be not defiled, which the
Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance."<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p></div>

<p>&mdash;they, therefore, by an ordinance passed in 1641, had required that
the body of every executed criminal should be buried within twelve
hours after death, except in cases of anatomy, which prevented the
possibility of hanging in chains after the English fashion; and the
only way in which they could set a mark of infamy upon the deceased
criminal, without a breach of the colonial ordinance as well as of the
divine law, was to burn the body.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>But this tendency to a strict adherence to the laws of Israel
disappeared early in the provincial period, under the operation of the
same causes which led to the abandonment of those rugged metaphrases
of the Psalms of David, and of the song of Deborah and Barak, &amp;c.,
contained in the Bay Psalm-Book, for the smoother though less literal
version of Tate and Brady and the presumptuous "Imitations" of Dr.
Watts. When, therefore, under the new charter the offence called for
it according to the custom of England, the gibbet was erected; and
though the occasions for its employment were very rare, the report of
sundry instances of its use has come down to us, as in the case of the
pirates whose bodies hung in chains, from time to time, on the now
vanished Bird Island in Boston Harbor, a locality as near the place
where the fact was committed as could conveniently be used. I confess
I find it impossible to understand whence the provincial judges
claimed to derive their authority for ordering the bodies of criminals
to be hung in chains. We have seen that, even if our fathers brought
with them the right to exercise this authority, they soon enacted
provisions entirely inconsistent with the practice; and I am not aware
of any subsequent act of parliament, extending to the Colonies, that
restored the authority; and certainly there was no law of the Province
to that effect.</p>

<p>I ought not to dismiss this subject without adding some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>thing to the
brief allusion already made to the comparative mildness of the laws of
Massachusetts in respect to capital punishment. The execution of Mark
and Phillis took place just about the time that Blackstone was
delivering his lectures at Oxford, which have since given him an
enduring and world-wide fame as a commentator on the laws of England.
This elegant defender and apologist for English laws and customs, in
his commentaries, admits, seemingly with reluctance and regret, that
there then existed on the statute-books of England no less than one
hundred and sixty capital offences. At that time the number of capital
offences in Massachusetts was less than one-tenth this number, if we
exclude those made so by the acts relating to military offenders in
actual service, and felonies on the high seas, and a few others,
which, like the latter, were created by including among capital crimes
certain offences which, though theretofore exempt from the death
penalty by special circumstances and technical rules, had always been
capitally punished when committed under other and not less justifiable
circumstances.</p>

<p>Said Isaac Backus, whom I find to be a very trustworthy authority, in
a letter to this Society, under date of Feb. 20, 1794, "There has not
been any person hanged in Plymouth County for above these sixty years
past."<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> More than a century earlier, John Dunton mentions a sermon
of Mather's, preached at the execution of "Morgan, the only person
executed in that country [Massachusetts] for near seven years."<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> He
must, however, I think, have forgotten the case of Maria, the negro
woman.</p>

<p>Again, when the English riot act (1 Geo. I. stat. 2, ch. 5) was
substantially adopted by the Province in 1751, the legislature
studiously avoided the harshness of the former act by substituting
forfeiture of lands and chattels, and whipping and imprisonment, for
the death penalty.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>In 1761 Governor Bernard vainly labored with his utmost zeal to secure
the passage of an act or acts making it felony, without benefit of
clergy, to forge public and private securities or vouchers for money,
or to coin or counterfeit the current money of the Province. He sent a
special message upon the subject to the Assembly, in which he
stated:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In regard to the popular prejudices against capital
punishments which have hitherto prevailed in this country, I
shall only say that at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span> present they are very ill-timed.
Whilst the people of this country lived from hand to mouth,
and had very little wealth but what was confined among
themselves, a simple system of laws might be proper, and
capital punishments might in a great measure be avoided; but
when by the acquisition, diffusion, and general intercourse
of wealth, the temptations to fraud are abundantly
increased, the terrors of it must be also proportionably
enlarged; otherwise if, through a false tenderness for
wicked men, the laws should not be sufficient to protect the
property of the honest and industrious, the rights of the
latter are given up to the former, and the undue mercy shown
to the one becomes a real injury to the other. To instance
this, I need only say that I have no doubt but that if these
crimes had been capital some years ago, and usually punished
as such, they would not have been committed at all at the
present time."</p></div>

<p>The Governor's opinion, however, was not borne out by the experience
of the British government in its dealings with crime. There, it was
made a capital felony to steal in a dwelling-house to the amount of
40<i>s.</i>, or, privately, in a shop, goods to the value of 5<i>s.</i>, or to
counterfeit stamps that were used for the sale of perfumery, or such
as were used for the certificates of hair-powder; and yet,
notwithstanding this severity, all who considered the subject
thoughtfully found that the increase of capital crimes more than kept
pace with the increase of laws creating them; and this became so
alarmingly evident that at length the conservative opposition to
reform was overborne, and Sir Samuel Romilly and his coadjutors began
those changes which have continued in the same direction to the
present day. Before the reform was established, however, executions
became so frequent that it was not uncommon for citizens to avoid
certain parts of London and its environs on account of the intolerable
odor, there, of decaying human bodies, hung in chains by the highways
and before the doors of citizens.</p>

<p>Still the judges rode their circuits, leaving briefly minuted
"calendars" in the hands of the executioners, who erected close behind
them the gallows and the gibbet as monuments of their dispensation of
"justice." Barristers bandied repartees and cracked jokes over good
dinners, and serjeants hobnobbed with their brethren of the bench and
of the coif, apparently unconcerned at the responsible part they were
enacting in this awful drama; while the poor rabble put on their best
attire on the days of execution, and liberally patronized the venders
of cakes and ale who, near the gallows, erected booths as on other
gala days,&mdash;many of the spectators, no doubt, thinking that it would
not be so bad a thing, after all, if it came their turn next to better
their desperate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span> condition by swinging on the newly contrived gallows,
on which ten criminals could be hanged together.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>Alas! well may we ask with astonishment if it is possible that such a
state of society really existed in the England of Hannah More, of Sir
William Jones and Edmund Burke,&mdash;the land throughout which the Wesleys
were preaching and singing to eager multitudes of the free grace and
abounding mercy of God; where the pious Cowper was pleading for the
relief of "insolvent innocence," and Clarkson and Wilberforce and
Granville Sharp were rousing the public mind to the evils of slavery
in distant colonies!</p>

<p>The case of petit treason which we have been considering occurred nine
years before Beccaria startled all Europe with "the code of
humanity,"&mdash;his treatise on crimes and punishments; yet had he known
of our experience in this Province, he could have pointed to
Massachusetts as the strongest practical illustration of the truth of
his theory, that it is not necessary to multiply extreme penalties in
order to prevent crime, but that we are to look for the amelioration
of manners and the diminution of public and private wrongs to the
mental and moral education of the people rather than to the terrors of
the law.</p>

<p>In 1777, when the Revolutionary War was beginning to assume its
gravest aspect, and when the hopes of traitors were reviving, the
barbarous incidents of the punishment for treason were abolished by
the legislature of Massachusetts, and this crime was made punishable
simply by hanging. Eight years later the distinction between petit
treason and murder was abolished,&mdash;an improvement of the criminal code
in which we were followed by Great Britain five years later still.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>So that it was possible that our good city of Boston might have been
disgraced by one of these horrible executions as late as 1785, and
that a delicate woman could, with all the solemnity of legal forms,
have been publicly burned to death at Tyburn as late as 1790!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span></p>

<p>In point of fact such executions occurred in England long after the
burning of Phillis. A memorable case is that of Anne Beddingfield, who
was burned for petit treason at Rushmore, near Ipswich, in 1763.</p>

<p>In 1813 the last of the minor infamous punishments, such as whipping,
branding, the stocks, the pillory, cutting off ears, slitting noses,
boring tongues, &amp;c., were abolished in this Commonwealth.</p>

<p>As for hanging in chains, I cannot find when the custom was
discontinued in Massachusetts. I do not remember to have read of an
instance of this kind since the adoption of the Constitution, though I
have made no special search for such an instance. Some of my hearers
may be able to refer me definitely to the time and reason of the
change.</p>

<p>In England, by the stat. 25 Geo. II., ch. 35 (1752), which was three
years before the execution at Cambridge, provision was made that
hanging in chains should be included in the sentence to be pronounced
by the court against all persons convicted of murder, and that the
sentence should be executed on the next day but one after it was
pronounced. This was changed by the stat. 9 Geo. IV., ch. 31, so as to
give the court a discretion to order hanging in chains or dissection;
and the next year this act was extended to Ireland. By the stat. 2 &amp; 3
Wm. IV., ch. 75, the court was authorized to order the body to be hung
in chains or buried; and, finally, by the stat. 4 &amp; 5 of Wm. IV., ch.
26 (July 25, 1834), all laws requiring bodies to be hung in chains
were repealed.</p>

<p>No such sudden punishment as that prescribed by the act of parliament
of the 25 Geo. II., could be legally inflicted here,&mdash;at least during
the colonial period; for the colonial ordinance of 1641 required that
four days at least should intervene between judgment and execution.</p>

<p>The only barbarous treatment of the bodies of criminals authorized by
law in Massachusetts since the adoption of the Constitution, that I am
aware of, was prescribed by the act of 1784, to discourage the
practice of duelling, which revived some of the provisions of a law of
the Province, passed in 1728, denying duellists the right to be buried
in a coffin, and requiring the coroner or executioner to see that
their bodies be interred near the place of execution, or in the public
highway, with a stake driven through them.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>Now, happily, capital punishment is restricted in this Commonwealth
and in England to two offences only; and while,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span> here, even high
treason is punishable simply by imprisonment, in England, strong
efforts have been repeatedly made, and recently with a fair prospect
of ultimate success, to induce parliament to imitate our example and
take away the death penalty from this the highest crime known to the
common law.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> The law was uncertain; but Hale appears to be the safest
authority. Wood, in his Institutes,&mdash;at the time of this trial the
most recent and popular treatise upon the laws of England,&mdash;states
that women were to be drawn, in petit treason; as, indeed, do most, if
not all, succeeding writers. They follow Coke, 3 Inst. 211; but
neither the statutes referred to, nor the case cited from 12 Ass. 30,
by the latter, support his statement. The report runs thus: "Alice <span class="gothic">de
W, qui fuit de l'age de xiij ans, fuit arse per judgment, pur ceo que
el'avoit tue sa Maistres, &amp; pur tant ceo fuit adjudge treason, &amp;c.</span>;"
and it appears that the case turned upon the question of
accountability, by reason of the tender age of the culprit. No mention
of drawing is made in the judgment. Compare H.P.C., i. p. 382, and
note, with Hawk. P.C., b. 2, ch. 48, &sect; 6, and authorities there
referred to, and Coke, <i>ut supra</i>. Also, see 4 Black. Comm. 204. It
will have been noticed that though the judgment against Phillis was
that she <i>go</i> to the place of execution, the warrant required that she
be drawn thither. The practice of drawing, in such cases, would have
been challenged, probably, if the cruelties anciently incident thereto
had not become obsolete.</p></div>

Instances of pardons and reprieves occur in our judicial history, but
they were invariably granted in the name of the king, by the
commander-in-chief; and, if for a graver offence than manslaughter, it
seems to have been understood that a pardon was not to be granted
without previous express direction from the king. This was in
compliance with a clause in the royal instructions, issued to all the
governors, by which they were enjoined not to remit any fines or
forfeitures above &pound;10 in amount, or to dispose of escheats, without
the royal sanction; forfeiture of lands and chattels being a
consequence of attainder upon conviction of the higher class of
felonies. The commission to Andros expressly excepted treason and
murder from the offences which he was authorized to pardon.</p></div>

</p><p>
That mistaken notions as to the nature of penalties to be inflicted in
criminal cases, and as to the authority of the bench to impose unusual
punishments, were not solely entertained in this distant colony, and
among men not bred to the law, may be shown by many instances in the
English law-books. One of the most notable is Sir Edw. Coke's
reference to the case of Peter Burchet, a prisoner in the Tower,&mdash;who
slew his keeper with a billet of wood, which drew blood,&mdash;as an
authority for inflicting the additional punishment of cutting off the
hand (under the stat. 33 Hen. VIII.) in the case of murder perpetrated
in the king's palace, when attended with bloodshed. In Elderton's
case, Chief Justice Holt, whose habits of thorough research were not
less remarkable than his absolute fairness and honesty, said, "I have
searched for the case cited [as Jones's case] about killing a man in
the Tower. It is Burdelt and Muskett's case. Being dissatisfied with
my Lord Coke's report of it, therefore I sent for the record, ... and
there is judgment of death given, but no judgment that his right hand
should be cut off. It is indeed so related in Stowe's Chronicle, and
in fact his hand was cut off, but there was no judgment for it."
